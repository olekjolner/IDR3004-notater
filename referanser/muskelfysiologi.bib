               undertaken frequently as structured exercise training are a
               potent stimulus for physiological adaptation in many organs.
               Specifically, in skeletal muscle, remarkable plasticity is
               demonstrated by the remodeling of muscle structure and function
               in terms of muscular size, force, endurance, and contractile
               velocity as a result of the functional demands induced by
               various types of exercise training. This plasticity, and the
               mechanistic basis for adaptations to skeletal muscle in response
               to exercise training, are underpinned by activation and/or
               repression of molecular pathways and processes in response to
               each individual acute exercise session. These pathways include
               the transduction of signals arising from neuronal, mechanical,
               metabolic, and hormonal stimuli through complex signal
               transduction networks, which are linked to a myriad of effector
               proteins involved in the regulation of pre- and
               posttranscriptional processes, and protein translation and
               degradation processes. This review therefore describes acute
               exercise-induced signal transduction and the molecular responses
               to acute exercise in skeletal muscle including emerging concepts
               such as epigenetic pre- and posttranscriptional regulation and
               the regulation of protein translation and degradation. A
               critical appraisal of methodological approaches and the current
               state of knowledge informs a series of recommendations offered
               as future directions in the field.",

              hypertrophy have been extensively researched since the landmark
              report by Morpurgo (1897) of ``work-induced hypertrophy'' in dogs
              that were treadmill trained. Much of the preclinical rodent and
              human resistance training research to date supports that involved
              mechanisms include enhanced mammalian/mechanistic target of
              rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, an expansion in
              translational capacity through ribosome biogenesis, increased
              satellite cell abundance and myonuclear accretion, and
              postexercise elevations in muscle protein synthesis rates.
              However, several lines of past and emerging evidence suggest that
              additional mechanisms that feed into or are independent of these
              processes are also involved. This review first provides a
              historical account of how mechanistic research into skeletal
              muscle hypertrophy has progressed. A comprehensive list of
              mechanisms associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy is then
              outlined, and areas of disagreement involving these mechanisms
              are presented. Finally, future research directions involving many
              of the discussed mechanisms are proposed.",
