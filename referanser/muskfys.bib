	abstract = {Repeated, episodic bouts of skeletal muscle contraction undertaken frequently as structured exercise training are a potent stimulus for physiological adaptation in many organs. Specifically, in skeletal muscle, remarkable plasticity is demonstrated by the remodeling of muscle structure and function in terms of muscular size, force, endurance, and contractile velocity as a result of the functional demands induced by various types of exercise training. This plasticity, and the mechanistic basis for adaptations to skeletal muscle in response to exercise training, are underpinned by activation and/or repression of molecular pathways and processes in response to each individual acute exercise session. These pathways include the transduction of signals arising from neuronal, mechanical, metabolic, and hormonal stimuli through complex signal transduction networks, which are linked to a myriad of effector proteins involved in the regulation of pre- and posttranscriptional processes, and protein translation and degradation processes. This review therefore describes acute exercise-induced signal transduction and the molecular responses to acute exercise in skeletal muscle including emerging concepts such as epigenetic pre- and posttranscriptional regulation and the regulation of protein translation and degradation. A critical appraisal of methodological approaches and the current state of knowledge informs a series of recommendations offered as future directions in the field.},

	doi = {10.1152/physrev.00039.2022},
	abstract = {Mechanisms underlying mechanical overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy have been extensively researched since the landmark report by Morpurgo (1897) of "work-induced hypertrophy" in dogs that were treadmill trained. Much of the preclinical rodent and human resistance training research to date supports that involved mechanisms include enhanced mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, an expansion in translational capacity through ribosome biogenesis, increased satellite cell abundance and myonuclear accretion, and postexercise elevations in muscle protein synthesis rates. However, several lines of past and emerging evidence suggest that additional mechanisms that feed into or are independent of these processes are also involved. This review first provides a historical account of how mechanistic research into skeletal muscle hypertrophy has progressed. A comprehensive list of mechanisms associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy is then outlined, and areas of disagreement involving these mechanisms are presented. Finally, future research directions involving many of the discussed mechanisms are proposed.},
