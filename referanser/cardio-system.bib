	abstract = {PURPOSE: The endurance training (ET)-induced increases in peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]O2peak) and cardiac output ([Formula: see text]peak) during upright cycling are reversed to pre-ET levels after removing the training-induced increase in blood volume (BV). We hypothesised that ET-induced improvements in [Formula: see text]O2peak and [Formula: see text]peak are preserved following phlebotomy of the BV gained with ET during supine but not during upright cycling. Arteriovenous O2 difference (a-[Formula: see text]O2diff; [Formula: see text]O2/[Formula: see text]), cardiac dimensions and muscle morphology were studied to assess their role for the [Formula: see text]O2peak improvement.
METHODS: Twelve untrained subjects ([Formula: see text]O2peak: 44 ± 6 ml kg-1 min-1) completed 10 weeks of supervised ET (3 sessions/week). Echocardiography, muscle biopsies, haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and BV were assessed pre- and post-ET. [Formula: see text]O2peak and [Formula: see text]peak during upright and supine cycling were measured pre-ET, post-ET and immediately after Hbmass was reversed to the individual pre-ET level by phlebotomy.
RESULTS: ET increased the Hbmass (3.3 ± 2.9\%; P = 0.005), BV (3.7 ± 5.6\%; P = 0.044) and [Formula: see text]O2peak during upright and supine cycling (11 ± 6\% and 10 ± 8\%, respectively; P ≤ 0.003). After phlebotomy, improvements in [Formula: see text]O2peak compared with pre-ET were preserved in both postures (11 ± 4\% and 11 ± 9\%; P ≤ 0.005), as was [Formula: see text]peak (9 ± 14\% and 9 ± 10\%; P ≤ 0.081). The increased [Formula: see text]peak and a-[Formula: see text]O2diff accounted for 70\% and 30\% of the [Formula: see text]O2peak improvements, respectively. Markers of mitochondrial density (CS and COX-IV; P ≤ 0.007) and left ventricular mass (P = 0.027) increased.
CONCLUSION: The ET-induced increase in [Formula: see text]O2peak was preserved despite removing the increases in Hbmass and BV by phlebotomy, independent of posture. [Formula: see text]O2peak increased primarily through elevated [Formula: see text]peak but also through a widened a-[Formula: see text]O2diff, potentially mediated by cardiac remodelling and mitochondrial biogenesis.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of knowledge regarding the contribution of central and peripheral factors to the increases in VO2max following sprint-interval training (SIT). This study investigated the importance of maximal cardiac output (Qmax ) in relation to VO2max improvements following SIT and the relative importance of the hypervolemic response on Qmax and VO2max . We also investigated whether systemic O2 extraction increased with SIT as has been previously suggested. Healthy men and women (n = 9) performed 6 weeks of SIT. State-of-the-art measurements: right heart catheterization, carbon monoxide rebreathing and respiratory gas exchange analysis were used to assess Qmax , arterial O2 content (ca O2 ), mixed venous O2 content (cv O2 ), blood volume (BV) and VO2max before and after the intervention. In order to assess the relative contribution of the hypervolemic response to the increases in VO2max , BV was re-established to pre-training levels by phlebotomy. Following the intervention, VO2max , BV and Qmax increased by 11\% (P {\textless} 0.001), 5.4\% (P = 0.013) and 8.8\% (P = 0.004), respectively. cv O2 decreased by 12.4\% (P = 0.011) and systemic O2 extraction increased by 4.0\% (P = 0.009) during the same period, both variables were unaffected by phlebotomy (P = 0.589 and P = 0.548, respectively). After phlebotomy, VO2max and Qmax reverted back to pre-intervention values (P = 0.064 and P = 0.838, respectively) and were significantly lower compared with post-intervention (P = 0.016 and P = 0.018, respectively). The decline in VO2max after phlebotomy was linear to the amount of blood removed (P = 0.007, R = -0.82). The causal relationship between BV, Qmax and VO2max shows that the hypervolemic response is a key mediator of the increases in VO2max following SIT. KEY POINTS: Sprint-interval training (SIT) is an exercise model involving supramaximal bouts of exercise interspersed with periods of rest known for its efficiency in improving maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max ). In contrast to the commonly accepted view where central haemodynamic adaptations are considered to be the key mediators of increases in VO2max there have been propositions highlighting peripheral adaptations as the main mediators in the context of SIT-induced changes in VO2max . By combining right heart catheterization, carbon monoxide rebreathing and phlebotomy, this study shows that increases in maximal cardiac output due to the expansion of the total blood volume is a major explanatory factor for the improvement in VO2max following SIT, with a smaller contribution from improved systemic oxygen extraction. The present work not only clarifies a controversy in the field by using state-of-the-art methods, but also encourages future research to investigate regulatory mechanisms that could explain how SIT can lead to improvements in VO2max and maximal cardiac output similar to those that have previously been reported for traditional endurance exercise.},

	doi = {10.1152/ajpregu.00028.2014},
	abstract = {With this study we tested the hypothesis that 6 wk of endurance training increases maximal cardiac output (Qmax) relatively more by elevating blood volume (BV) than by inducing structural and functional changes within the heart. Nine healthy but untrained volunteers (Vo2max 47 ± 5 ml·min(-1)·kg(-1)) underwent supervised training (60 min; 4 times weekly at 65\% Vo2max for 6 wk), and Qmax was determined by inert gas rebreathing during cycle ergometer exercise before and after the training period. After the training period, blood volume (determined in duplicates by CO rebreathing) was reestablished to pretraining values by phlebotomy and Qmax was quantified again. Resting echography revealed no structural heart adaptations as a consequence of the training intervention. After the training period, plasma volume (PV), red blood cell volume (RBCV), and BV increased (P {\textless} 0.05) by 147 ± 168 (5 ± 5\%), 235 ± 64 (10 ± 3\%), and 382 ± 204 ml (7 ± 4\%), respectively. Vo2max was augmented (P {\textless} 0.05) by 10 ± 7\% after the training period and decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) by 8 ± 7\% with phlebotomy. Concomitantly, Qmax was increased (P {\textless} 0.05) from 18.9 ± 2.1 to 20.4 ± 2.3 l/min (9 ± 6\%) as a consequence of the training intervention, and after normalization of BV by phlebotomy Qmax returned to pretraining values (18.1 ± 2.5 l/min; 12 ± 5\% reversal). Thus the exercise training-induced increase in BV is the main mechanism increasing Qmax after 6 wk of endurance training in previously untrained subjects.},

	abstract = {It remains unclear whether improvements in peak oxygen uptake (V̇(O2peak)) following endurance training (ET) are primarily determined by central and/or peripheral adaptations. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that the improvement in V̇(O2peak) following 6 weeks of ET is mainly determined by haematological rather than skeletal muscle adaptations. Sixteen untrained healthy male volunteers (age = 25 ± 4 years, V̇(O2peak) = 3.5 ± 0.5 l min(-1)) underwent supervised ET (6 weeks, 3-4 sessions per week). V̇(O2peak), peak cardiac output (Q̇(peak)), haemoglobin mass (Hb(mass)) and blood volumes were assessed prior to and following ET. Skeletal muscle biopsies were analysed for mitochondrial volume density (Mito(VD)), capillarity, fibre types and respiratory capacity (OXPHOS). After the post-ET assessment, red blood cell volume (RBCV) was re-established at the pre-ET level by phlebotomy and V̇(O2peak) and Q̇(peak) were measured again. We speculated that the contribution of skeletal muscle adaptations to the ET-induced increase in V̇(O2peak) would be revealed when controlling for haematological adaptations. V̇(O2peak) and Q̇(peak) were increased (P {\textless} 0.05) following ET (9 ± 8 and 7 ± 6\%, respectively) and decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) after phlebotomy (-7 ± 7 and -10 ± 7\%). RBCV, plasma volume and Hb(mass) all increased (P {\textless} 0.05) after ET (8 ± 4, 4 ± 6 and 6 ± 5\%). As for skeletal muscle adaptations, capillary-to-fibre ratio and total Mito(VD) increased (P {\textless} 0.05) following ET (18 ± 16 and 43 ± 30\%), but OXPHOS remained unaltered. Through stepwise multiple regression analysis, Q̇(peak), RBCV and Hb(mass) were found to be independent predictors of V̇(O2peak). In conclusion, the improvement in V̇(O2peak) following 6 weeks of ET is primarily attributed to increases in Q̇(peak) and oxygen-carrying capacity of blood in untrained healthy young subjects.},
